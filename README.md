# Sakura Express / FirebaseHomework

# What it Does
This is a simple train application intended for displaying an upcoming train schedule. Behind the scenes, the data is collected in Firebase.

# How to Use it
Simply put in the name of the train you would like to see. This is still a work in progress and it doesn't work yet, but once it does you will see the data appended to the screen.
